## Summary
The commit enhances the `langgraph_agent.py` by implementing a method `_generate_error_log` to create detailed error logs based on multi-agent analysis results. This method compiles issues from various domains including security, code quality, and documentation, providing a comprehensive report on vulnerabilities, suggestions for improvements, and an overview of missing or problematic documentation.

## Files Changed
- **langgraph_agent.py**: Added a new method `_generate_error_log` to generate detailed error logs from analysis results.

## Key Changes
- **Error Logging**: Introduced a comprehensive error logging mechanism that aggregates and formats analysis data into structured sections, including security issues, code quality issues, and documentation issues.
- **Result Interpretation**: The new method also provides a summary of analysis metrics, such as the number of agents run, total tokens used, estimated cost, and execution time.
- **Security and Quality Reporting**: Enhanced reporting for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues, including severity levels, impact descriptions, and code snippets where applicable.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies added.
- No configuration changes noted.
- No API changes or new endpoints introduced.
- No database schema changes detected.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps could include:
- Further refining the error log output to include more granular details or additional types of analysis if required.
- Integration of this error logging with other parts of the application to automate error report generation post-analysis.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the logging mechanism to adapt to new security, quality, or documentation analysis tools that may be introduced into the system.
