## Summary
The commit introduces a comprehensive plan for expanding the Auto-Brainlift tool to support multiple projects, enhancing usability through UI improvements, and implementing multi-tier caching and smart cost optimization features. This plan is laid out in a newly added document, detailing a phased development strategy to scale up the system's capabilities and efficiency.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: New document added outlining a phased expansion plan for the Auto-Brainlift tool, detailing new features, UI enhancements, multi-project support, and cost optimization strategies.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a multi-project management capability allowing Auto-Brainlift to handle multiple development projects simultaneously.
- Enhancement of the user interface with new controls for project management, including project switching, cost tracking, and budget status indicators.
- Implementation of a multi-tier caching system to reduce API costs and optimize token usage.
- Introduction of smart routing to manage query processing based on budget constraints and cache availability.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: Implementation of new caching and budget management systems might require additional libraries for caching and vector operations (e.g., Redis, NumPy).
- **Configuration Changes**: Addition of `projects.json` for storing project-specific settings and metadata.
- **API Changes**: Likely inclusion of new endpoints or methods for project management, such as switching projects and accessing project-specific settings.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of new database structures for caching (`semantic.db`, `exact.db`) and per-project storage organization.

## Next Steps
Following the outlined expansion plan, the next logical steps would involve the actual implementation of the UI enhancements and the multi-project management framework as described in the Phase 1 checklist. Subsequently, developing the caching layers and integrating smart cost optimization features as planned in Phase 2 would follow. Testing for system efficiency, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness will be crucial throughout these phases.
