## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements to the `parse_git_diff` method in the `GitCommitSummarizer` class within the `langgraph_agent.py` file to handle Work in Progress (WIP) changes more effectively. The method now supports parsing differences not only from committed changes but also from uncommitted (WIP) changes in the working directory, providing a more comprehensive overview of current modifications either staged or unstaged.

## Files Changed
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**: Modified `parse_git_diff` method to handle WIP changes, including staged and unstaged modifications.

## Key Changes
- Enhanced `parse_git_diff` to differentiate between WIP and committed states, allowing for dynamic parsing based on the current state of the repository.
- Introduced error handling for unknown WIP modes to ensure robustness.
- Implemented logging to provide clear feedback during the parsing process, improving traceability and debugging.
- Added timestamp and user information generation for WIP changes, simulating commit metadata for uncommitted changes.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies added.
- No API changes or new endpoints introduced.
- No database schema changes.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on refining the WIP parsing feature to include more detailed differentiation of changes, such as distinguishing between different types of files or changes. Enhancements to logging to include more detailed context about the changes being parsed could also be beneficial. Further, addressing the identified security and quality issues will be crucial to maintaining the reliability and security of the system.
