## Summary
The commit introduces a comprehensive expansion plan for the Auto-Brainlift system, transitioning it from a single-project tool to a robust multi-project support system. This upgrade includes enhanced user interface features for better project management, introduces a multi-tier caching system for cost optimization, and implements intelligent routing to manage API usage effectively based on the project's budget.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: New file created to outline the phased approach for expanding Auto-Brainlift capabilities, including UI enhancements, multi-project support, smart caching, and cost optimization strategies.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a **multi-project architecture** to handle multiple development projects simultaneously, enhancing the tool's scalability.
- Enhanced **UI controls** for project management, including project switching, history viewing, and settings for API keys and budgets.
- Development of a **multi-tier caching system** to reduce API costs and improve response times, including exact match cache and semantic cache.
- Implementation of **smart routing** to optimize API usage based on available budget, ensuring cost-effective operation.
- **Smart diff chunking** and a **token budget manager** aim to efficiently manage token usage and adhere to budget constraints per project.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None specified directly in the commit, but the implementation hints at potential needs for libraries supporting caching and vector operations.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of `projects.json` for storing project configurations and state.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Usage of local databases (`semantic.db` and `exact.db`) to support caching mechanisms.

## Next Steps
Further development could focus on implementing the outlined features in the EXPANSION_PLAN.md, particularly:
- Completing the UI enhancements as per the design to ensure smooth user experience across multiple projects.
- Finalizing the caching system's implementation, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing infrastructure.
- Extensive testing of the new multi-project functionality and caching system to validate performance improvements and cost savings.
- Continuous monitoring and tweaking of the smart routing logic to optimize API usage and maintain budget control.
