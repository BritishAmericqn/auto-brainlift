## Summary
The commit `9a59181b` introduces foundational changes to the Auto-Brainlift application, transforming it from a single-project tool to a multi-project development assistant. This enhancement includes a new user interface for managing multiple projects and an expanded architecture to support individual project settings, caching, and cost tracking.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: Newly created file outlining the expansion plan for Auto-Brainlift, detailing phases, goals, implementation checklists, and testing procedures for new features aimed at supporting multiple projects.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a multi-project user interface, including new controls for project management and status indicators.
- Establishment of a multi-project architecture with individual project registries and storage paths.
- Implementation plans for a multi-tier caching system to optimize API costs and smart routing based on budget constraints.
- Introduction of smart diff chunking to manage token usage efficiently.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None specified directly in the commit, but potential dependencies could include libraries for handling JSON data and UI development libraries for the new controls.
- **Configuration Changes**:
  - New project registry configuration in `~/.auto-brainlift/projects.json` for storing project paths, settings, and metadata.
  - Expanded directory structure under `~/.auto-brainlift/` to accommodate separate caches and outputs for each project.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: While not explicitly mentioned, the commit suggests modifications to internal APIs to handle project-specific data fetching and settings management.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of file-based storage for caching (`semantic.db` and `exact.db`) and project-specific data (`projects.json`).

## Next Steps
Following the foundational setup for multi-project support, the next logical steps include the actual implementation of the UI enhancements and the multi-project architecture as outlined in the plan. This will likely involve integrating the backend changes with the frontend, rigorous testing of the new multi-project environment, and fine-tuning the caching and smart routing mechanisms to ensure they meet the performance and cost-saving goals. Additionally, monitoring and adjusting the new system based on user feedback and usage patterns will be crucial to ensure scalability and efficiency.
