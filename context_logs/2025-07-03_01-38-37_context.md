## Summary
The commit `e0b84370` by Benjamin Royston successfully completes the integration of a comprehensive Style Guide System into the project. This update encompasses the full implementation and testing of directory structures, parsers, file upload backends, UI extensions, and JavaScript integrations, marking a significant enhancement in how style guides are handled within the software.

## Files Changed
- **CURSOR_AI_CHECKLIST.md**: Updated checklist to reflect the completion of all steps involved in the Style Guide System integration.
- **agents/style_guide_parser.py**: Introduced new file to handle the parsing of different style guide formats.
- **electron/main.js**: Enhanced to include new file upload handlers and validation processes.
- **index.html**: Modified to include new UI components for the Style Guide Integration in settings.

## Key Changes
- Completion of the Style Guide System, marked by checklists in the documentation.
- Implementation of `StyleGuideParser` class with methods to parse various file types and format them according to the project's requirements.
- Enhanced file upload backend in `electron/main.js` with comprehensive file validation and processing capabilities.
- New UI features in `index.html` to facilitate user interaction with the style guide integration, including file uploads and previews.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added explicitly in the provided diff, but the implementation likely depends on existing Python and JavaScript libraries.
- **Configuration Changes**: Enhanced handling and processing configurations to support new file types and their respective parsing in the system.
- **API Changes**: Introduction of new IPC handler 'style-guide:upload' with enhanced parameters for file handling and processing.

## Next Steps
Given the completion of the Style Guide System, future development could focus on optimizing the integration, such as improving parsing efficiency or extending support for more file types. Another logical step could be the enhancement of user feedback mechanisms in the UI to provide real-time parsing errors or warnings to the users. Additionally, considering the integration's impact, regression testing and user acceptance testing (UAT) could be prioritized to ensure robust functionality across various user scenarios.
