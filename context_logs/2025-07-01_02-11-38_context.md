## Summary
The commit implements foundational changes to support multiple projects in the Auto-Brainlift tool, transitioning it from a single-project to a multi-project development assistant. This includes enhancements to the user interface, the introduction of a comprehensive project management system, and the establishment of a multi-tier caching system aimed at optimizing costs and API usage.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: Introduced as a new file, providing a detailed expansion plan for integrating multi-project support and smart caching mechanisms into Auto-Brainlift.

## Key Changes
- **Multi-Project Support**: Enabling Auto-Brainlift to handle multiple projects simultaneously, including UI enhancements for project management (switching, adding, and tracking projects).
- **Project Management Architecture**: Establishment of a project registry and per-project storage system to manage multiple projects efficiently.
- **Enhanced UI Controls**: New controls and indicators added for better project management and cost tracking, including a token usage meter and budget status indicator.
- **Multi-Tier Caching System**: Implementation plan for a caching system with exact match, semantic analysis, and smart routing to optimize API calls and reduce operational costs.
- **Smart Diff Chunking and Budget Management**: Introduction of a diff chunking system to manage token usage effectively and a token budget manager to oversee API cost implications.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None specified in the diff.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of `projects.json` for project registry, and updates to local storage directories for caching and outputs per project.
- **API Changes**: Not directly mentioned, but changes implied in the management of project-specific data and caching mechanisms.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Implementation of new local database schemas for exact and semantic caching (`semantic.db` and `exact.db`).

## Next Steps
Future developments could focus on fully implementing the caching system and refining the smart routing mechanism to enhance performance and cost-efficiency. Further UI enhancements and testing under multi-project scenarios would also be crucial to ensure robustness and user satisfaction. Additionally, the integration of these systems into the existing codebase and ensuring backward compatibility will be essential.
