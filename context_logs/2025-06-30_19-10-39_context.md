## Summary
A new Python script named `test.py` was created to demonstrate a basic functionality of printing a message. The script includes a definition of a function `hello_world()` that outputs a greeting message. This function is executed when the script is run as the main program, ensuring that the message is printed only under direct execution.

## Files Changed
- **test.py**: New file added containing a simple function to print a greeting and a conditional check to execute the function.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of `hello_world()` function to demonstrate basic Python functionality.
- Implementation of the standard Python idiom `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added.
- No configuration changes made.
- No API changes or new endpoints introduced.
- No database schema changes occurred.

## Next Steps
Future developments could expand the functionality of `test.py` by adding more complex computations or integrating with external APIs to fetch data before printing. Integration testing could also be considered to ensure module compatibility when imported. Additionally, considering the simplicity of the current implementation, adding error handling and logging might be beneficial for more robust script execution.
