## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements to the Electron-based application by expanding its integration with Slack and improving asynchronous operations within the `main.js` module. Key additions include a new Slack progress update feature and the promisification of the `exec` function to support async/await patterns. These changes aim to streamline the project management workflow and facilitate more effective communication of project statuses through Slack.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Added new IPC handlers for Slack integration, implemented async utility functions, and expanded the usage of child processes.

## Key Changes
- **Slack Integration Enhancement**: Added functionality to send progress updates to Slack, which includes gathering and sending information regarding current work status, recent commits, and uncommitted changes.
- **Asynchronous Execution Handling**: Integrated the `promisify` utility from Node.js to handle child process executions (`exec`) asynchronously, enhancing the performance and maintainability of the codebase.
  
## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: Utilized `promisify` from the `util` module to handle asynchronous processes.
- **Configuration Changes**: None specified directly, but usage suggests potential updates in configuration handling for Slack in the project's settings.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Introduced new IPC message handlers such as `slack:send-progress-update` for backend-to-frontend communication regarding Slack updates.

## Next Steps
Given the enhancements made in this commit, the next logical steps could include:
- Further testing and debugging of the new Slack integration features to ensure reliability and efficiency.
- Enhancing error handling and logging capabilities to provide more robust feedback loops for the new features.
- Considering the expansion of the Slack integration to include more interactive features such as real-time feedback or commands from Slack to the application.

These steps will help in refining the current implementations and expanding the application's functionalities in alignment with project management and team collaboration goals.
