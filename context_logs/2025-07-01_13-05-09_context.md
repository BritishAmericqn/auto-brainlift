## Summary
This commit introduces a comprehensive smart caching system designed to optimize performance and reduce costs in the Auto-Brainlift project. Significant enhancements include the implementation of a three-tier caching strategy and various fixes to ensure system reliability and data accuracy. Additionally, a new guide document provides detailed instructions and architecture insights for this phase of development.

## Files Changed
- **Expanded_Checklist.txt**: Updated checklist to reflect the completion of tasks related to caching and system optimization.
- **PHASE2_CACHING_GUIDE.md**: New file providing a detailed guide on the newly implemented multi-tier caching system.

## Key Changes
- **Three-tier Caching System Implemented**: Includes exact match cache, semantic cache, and full LLM processing to optimize query handling.
- **Smart Query Router**: Developed to prioritize cache usage and manage computational resources efficiently.
- **Cache Management Enhancements**: Improvements such as real data display in cache stats and path corrections for smoother integration across different operating systems.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive guide detailing the caching system architecture, key features, and implementation specifics.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: Likely dependencies on vector database solutions and text embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) for the semantic cache.
- **Configuration Changes**: New environment variables for PROJECT_ID and BUDGET settings to manage system behavior dynamically.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No explicit API changes noted, but internal API adjustments may be inferred due to the architectural overhaul in caching.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of SQLite storage for the semantic cache, utilizing vector operations.

## Next Steps
Future developments could focus on refining the caching algorithms, expanding the analytics dashboard capabilities, and further optimizing cost management tools. Additional testing and user feedback collection on the new caching system would help in fine-tuning performance and reliability.
