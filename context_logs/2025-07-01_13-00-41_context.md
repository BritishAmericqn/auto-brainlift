## Summary
The latest commit implements a sophisticated multi-tier caching system for the Auto-Brainlift project, aimed at reducing API costs and improving response times. This update marks the completion of several key items in the project's build checklist and introduces comprehensive documentation for the new caching system.

## Files Changed
- **Expanded_Checklist.txt**: Updated the build checklist, marking several tasks as completed and adding fixes related to path mismatches and cache statistics display.
- **PHASE2_CACHING_GUIDE.md**: Added a new file that serves as a detailed guide for the newly implemented multi-tier caching system, describing its architecture, features, and operational details.

## Key Changes
- **Implementation of Multi-Tier Caching System**: Completed the setup of a 3-tier caching system including exact match, semantic similarity, and full LLM processing to optimize cost and efficiency.
- **Documentation of Caching System**: Introduced a detailed guide explaining the operational principles, architecture, and user-configurable settings for the caching system.
- **Checklist Updates and Fixes**: Resolved issues related to system paths and import statements, and updated cache statistics to display real data.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: No new external dependencies were indicated in the commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: Environment variables for `PROJECT_ID` and `BUDGET` settings are now passed to the Python agent via the main process, as seen in the architecture diagrams.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned in the commit, but the system's architecture suggests possible internal API adjustments for cache and budget management.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of SQLite storage for semantic cache with vector operations, as described in the new guide.

## Next Steps
With the caching system now in place, the next steps could involve rigorous testing to ensure the system's efficiency and reliability. Additionally, further optimization and tuning of the caching parameters based on real-world usage data could enhance system performance and cost-effectiveness.
