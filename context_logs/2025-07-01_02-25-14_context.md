## Summary
The commit introduces foundational modifications to the Auto-Brainlift application, enabling it to operate across multiple development projects and enhancing its UI with various project management controls. It outlines a phased expansion plan, with the initial phase focusing on multi-project support and UI enhancements, and the second phase aimed at implementing smart caching mechanisms and cost optimization strategies.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: Newly added file that details the expansion strategy for Auto-Brainlift to support multiple projects, improve UI, and introduce cost-effective caching systems.

## Key Changes
- Introduced the concept of handling multiple projects within Auto-Brainlift, including UI controls for project switching and management.
- Added detailed implementation checklists for UI enhancements and multi-project architecture in the first phase, and advanced caching systems and cost optimizations in the second phase.
- Planned for a multi-tier caching system to significantly reduce API costs and implement budget-aware processing.
- Proposed a smart routing system that dynamically chooses the most cost-effective processing model based on query complexity and remaining budget.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: The implementation suggests the addition of new modules like `cache_manager.py`, `semantic_cache.py`, `smart_router.py`, `diff_chunker.py`, and `budget_manager.py` for handling caching, budgeting, and smart routing functionalities.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of a `projects.json` file to manage project configurations and metadata storage per project, which includes settings like token budget and enabled agents.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Implementation of a file-based schema under `~/.auto-brainlift/` with directories for cache and outputs specific to each project, facilitating isolated storage management.

## Next Steps
Further development should focus on the actual implementation of the UI enhancements and multi-project architecture as outlined in the expansion plan. Following that, the next logical step would be to develop and rigorously test the multi-tier caching system and the smart diff chunking mechanisms to ensure they meet the performance and cost reduction goals. Continuous integration and testing will be crucial to handle the complexity introduced by multi-project support and advanced caching strategies.
