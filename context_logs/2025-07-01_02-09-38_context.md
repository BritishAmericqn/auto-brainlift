## Summary
The commit introduces a comprehensive expansion plan for the Auto-Brainlift tool, focusing on transitioning it from a single-project to a multi-project development assistant. This expansion includes enhancements in user interface, project management, and cost optimization features, along with the implementation of multi-tier caching and smart agent routing to minimize API costs and efficiently manage token usage.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: A new documentation file outlining the phased expansion strategy for Auto-Brainlift, including detailed implementation checklists for UI enhancements, multi-project architecture, smart caching, and cost optimization strategies.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a UI enhancement plan, including new controls for project management and status indicators.
- Development of a multi-project architecture allowing the tool to handle multiple projects simultaneously, including a project registry and per-project storage system.
- Implementation strategies for a multi-tier caching system to reduce API costs and optimize token usage.
- Proposal for smart diff chunking and a budget manager to maintain efficient token usage within user-set limits.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: No new dependencies introduced in this commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: Project-specific configurations stored in `~/.auto-brainlift/projects.json`, enabling customized settings per project.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No API changes or new endpoints detailed in this commit.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of a new local storage schema under `~/.auto-brainlift/` for caching and output management, segmented by project ID.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would involve the actual implementation of the outlined features, starting with UI enhancements and foundational multi-project support structures. Subsequent phases would focus on implementing the caching system and optimizing cost management strategies as detailed in the expansion plan. Testing these new features for performance, responsiveness, and accuracy in cost tracking will be crucial to ensure the tool's effectiveness and efficiency in a multi-project environment.
