## Summary
The commit implements the full functionality of Auto-Brainlift, an AI-powered tool that generates dual-purpose documentation post-Git commit. This includes both technical summaries for AI coding assistants and personal reflective journal entries for developers. The implementation integrates Git hooks for automatic processing and introduces a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle failures in documentation generation.

## Files Changed
- **.gitignore**: Updated to exclude directories and files related to Auto-Brainlift such as `.processed_commits`, `.retry_queue.json`, `brainlifts/`, and `context_logs/`.
- **Expanded_Checklist.txt**: Marked the creation of necessary folders at the root level as completed.
- **README.md**: Overhauled to describe the features, installation steps, usage, and project structure of Auto-Brainlift.

## Key Changes
- Added automatic generation of AI-targeted and developer-focused documentation immediately after Git commits.
- Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle failures during documentation generation.
- Set up Git hooks and cron jobs to facilitate background processing and automation.
- Enhanced the user interface to display retry status and notifications.
- Comprehensive documentation provided in the README to guide users on installation, configuration, and usage.

## Technical Details
- **Dependencies Added**: Python environment setup is required alongside Node.js, indicating possible integration of Python scripts or services.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of `.env` for storing environment variables like the OpenAI API key.
- **API Changes/New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the use of OpenAI API suggests external API interactions for generating summaries.

## Next Steps
Future developments could focus on expanding platform compatibility beyond macOS, enhancing error handling capabilities, and refining the user interface based on user feedback. Further integration with other IDEs or version control systems could also be considered to broaden the tool's applicability.
