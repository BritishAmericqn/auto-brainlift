## Summary
The latest commit introduces multi-project support for Auto-Brainlift, transforming it from a single-project tool to one capable of managing multiple projects simultaneously. This enhancement includes the development of a user interface for project management, architecture for handling multiple projects, and the initial implementation of cost optimization strategies.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: New file created to outline the phased expansion plan of Auto-Brainlift, detailing new features, UI enhancements, and architectural changes for supporting multiple projects.

## Key Changes
- Introduced a **multi-project architecture**, enabling Auto-Brainlift to manage and switch between multiple development projects efficiently.
- Added **UI enhancements** for better project management, including new controls for project switching, project state displays, and quick action buttons.
- Developed a preliminary **cost tracking and budgeting system** to monitor and optimize expenses associated with AI operations.
- Planned for **smart caching and cost optimization** features to significantly reduce operational costs by implementing multi-tier caching systems and budget-aware routing of queries.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None specified directly in the commit, but the implementation of caching and budget management suggests potential dependencies on database management systems or in-memory data stores.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of `projects.json` for storing project-specific settings and paths, indicating a shift towards a more configurable environment.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the UI changes imply updates to the front-end that may require new API endpoints for managing project data and settings.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Implementation of project-specific caches (`semantic.db`, `exact.db`) and outputs directories suggest new database schemas or data structures for handling cache and output data on a per-project basis.

## Next Steps
Future development will likely focus on completing the implementation of the planned features such as the multi-tier caching system and smart diff chunking for efficient token usage. Testing these new features for performance and accuracy, especially in a multi-project environment, will be crucial. Further refinement of the UI and the backend to ensure seamless project management and cost optimization would also be essential steps moving forward.
