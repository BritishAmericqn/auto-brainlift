## Summary
The commit implements a comprehensive multi-agent system for the Auto-Brainlift application, providing a modular architecture that allows for specific agent functionalities such as security analysis, code quality assessment, and documentation evaluation. The system is designed to be configurable and scalable, with agents that can be independently toggled and executed in various modes (parallel, sequential, priority). This flexibility supports a wide range of user needs and budget constraints.

## Files Changed
- **MULTI_AGENT_README.md**: New file created, providing detailed documentation on the multi-agent system's architecture, usage, configuration, integration, and management features.
- **agent_orchestrator.py**: New file created, containing the main orchestrator code to manage and coordinate the execution of multiple agents.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of an **Agent Orchestrator** (`agent_orchestrator.py`) to manage the execution of multiple specialized agents.
- Detailed documentation and setup instructions added in **MULTI_AGENT_README.md** for guiding users and developers on the configuration and operation of the multi-agent system.
- Configuration flexibility through environment variables and UI settings to enable/disable agents and select execution modes.
- Integration strategies detailed for combining the multi-agent system with existing workflows and technologies like Electron and LangGraph.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: The system might rely on additional Python libraries like `asyncio` and `concurrent.futures` for asynchronous operations and thread management, although specific new dependencies beyond the standard library are not listed.
- **Configuration Changes**: New environment variables introduced to control agent behavior and execution modes.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: While specific API changes are not detailed, the system's architecture suggests potential modifications to how agents are initialized and how their outputs are managed within the application workflow.

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could focus on:
1. Allowing users to create **Custom Agents** to extend the system's capabilities.
2. **Agent Chaining** to define dependencies and execution orders between different agents, optimizing the analysis workflow.
3. More sophisticated **Result Aggregation** methods to combine findings from multiple agents seamlessly.
4. Introduction of **Custom Prompts** and **Performance Metrics** tracking to enhance user interaction and system monitoring.

These steps would enhance both the functionality and user experience of the multi-agent system, making it a more powerful and flexible tool in code analysis and management.
