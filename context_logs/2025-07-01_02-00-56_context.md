## Summary
The commit introduces a comprehensive expansion plan for the Auto-Brainlift tool to support multiple projects concurrently, enhancing user interface features for project management, and implementing smart caching systems for cost optimization. It outlines a phased approach to incrementally introduce these features, starting with foundational multi-project support and UI enhancements, followed by advanced caching mechanisms to optimize operational costs.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: New file created to document the phased expansion plan for Auto-Brainlift, detailing goals, implementation checklists, and testing strategies for each phase.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of **multi-project support**, allowing Auto-Brainlift to manage and switch between multiple development projects efficiently.
- **UI enhancements** including new controls for project management and indicators for project status such as budget and cost.
- Establishment of a **multi-tier caching system** aimed at reducing API costs and optimizing token usage through exact match caching, semantic caching, and smart routing based on budget constraints.
- **Smart diff chunking** and a **token budget management** system to control costs and enhance efficiency in processing diffs.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None mentioned explicitly in the diff.
- **Configuration Changes**: New project configuration files (`projects.json`) introduced to manage project settings and state.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the architecture suggests potential new internal APIs for cache management and project switching.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of new local storage schema for caching (`semantic.db`, `exact.db`) and project-specific data storage under `~/.auto-brainlift/`.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would include the actual implementation of the UI enhancements and caching systems as outlined in the expansion plan. This will involve developing the frontend components for the new UI features, backend services for managing the multi-project architecture, and integrating the caching mechanisms. Subsequent testing will need to verify the functionality and performance impacts of these new features. Further, monitoring and fine-tuning the system based on real-world usage data would likely follow the initial rollout and testing phases.
