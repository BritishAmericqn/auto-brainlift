## Summary
A new test file named `test_hook.txt` was added to the repository to verify the functionality of the Auto-Brainlift Git hook integration. This file is intended to automatically trigger a sequence of actions upon committing, which includes invoking a post-commit hook, executing a specific script (`git_hook_handler.py`), and engaging the LangGraph agent to generate summaries. This test ensures the Git hook setup is functioning as expected.

## Files Changed
- `test_hook.txt`: New file created to test the Git hook integration and to describe the sequence of triggered actions upon commit.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of a test file for Git hooks**: Validates the operational setup and integration of Git hooks within the project.
- **Automation sequence described**: Outlines the automated tasks that should occur post-commit, including script execution and agent invocation, which are crucial for automated workflows and continuous integration processes.

## Technical Details
- **No new dependencies added**.
- **No configuration changes noted**.
- **No API changes or new endpoints introduced**.
- **No database schema changes**.

## Next Steps
The logical next steps would be to monitor this integration for effectiveness and reliability in triggering the specified sequences upon commits. If successful, further enhancements to the Git hook scripts may be considered to expand automation capabilities or streamline other development processes. Additionally, reviewing logs and outputs from the `git_hook_handler.py` script and the LangGraph agent will provide insights into any adjustments needed for optimal functionality.
