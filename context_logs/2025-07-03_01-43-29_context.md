## Summary
The latest commit by Benjamin Royston has successfully completed the integration of a style guide system within the project. This involved creating various directories and files, implementing a style guide parser with multiple functionalities, enhancing file upload backend capabilities, extending the settings UI, and integrating relevant JavaScript functionalities. All these components are now fully operational and marked as completed.

## Files Changed
- **CURSOR_AI_CHECKLIST.md**: Updated checklist to reflect the completion of the style guide integration system.
- **agents/style_guide_parser.py**: Newly created file housing the StyleGuideParser class with methods to parse and format style rules.
- **electron/main.js**: Enhanced to handle file uploads, validations, and processing.
- **index.html**: Updated with new UI components for the style guide integration section.

## Key Changes
- The **StyleGuideParser** class was created to handle different file formats and convert them into a unified style guide format.
- File upload handling in **electron/main.js** was extended to include validation, processing, and integration with Python scripts.
- The **Settings UI** in `index.html` was enhanced to allow users to manage style guide files directly through the interface.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added in this commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: Implementation of file paths and handling procedures for style guide files.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No new API endpoints were introduced; however, internal IPC handling for file uploads was significantly modified.

## Next Steps
With the completion of the style guide system, the next logical steps could involve rigorous testing under different scenarios to ensure robustness. Additionally, considering enhancements for handling more complex file structures or integrating real-time style guide updates could further improve the systemâ€™s functionality.
