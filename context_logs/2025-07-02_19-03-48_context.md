## Summary
This Git commit marks the completion of Phase 1 of the project, which focused on implementing a comprehensive Git workflow foundation within an Electron application. The changes involve finalizing functionality for Git operations (status, commit, push, and pull), integrating an AI Commit Message Generator, and extending frontend API capabilities. The commit also prepares the project for the kickoff of Phase 2 by updating documentation and marking all tasks under Phase 1 as completed.

## Files Changed
- `electron/main.js`: Added IPC handlers for git operations and AI commit message generator, marked all tasks as completed.
- `electron/preload.js`: Extended the frontend API to include new git functionalities.
- `agents/commit_message_generator.py`: Created and implemented the AI commit message generator script using the GPT-4o-mini model.

## Key Changes
- Added comprehensive IPC handlers for Git operations including commit, push, and pull.
- Implemented an AI-powered commit message generator that interfaces with the Electron backend.
- Extended the frontend API to make Git functionalities accessible through the renderer process.

## Technical Details
- New dependencies: None added in this commit.
- Configuration changes: None specified in the commit.
- API changes: Extended `electronAPI` in `preload.js` to include new Git functionalities.
- Database schema changes: None mentioned.

## Next Steps
With Phase 1 completed, Phase 2 will likely focus on refining these implementations, enhancing user interface interactions, and possibly integrating more robust error handling and security features based on the feedback and issues noted in the development context.
