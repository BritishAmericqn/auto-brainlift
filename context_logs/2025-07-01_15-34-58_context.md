## Summary
This commit introduces a comprehensive error logging function within the `langgraph_agent.py` file, designed to generate detailed error logs from multi-agent analysis results. The function aggregates insights from security, code quality, and documentation analyses, presenting them in a structured, readable format. This enhancement improves the traceability and diagnosability of issues across multiple dimensions of the software development process.

## Files Changed
- `agents/langgraph_agent.py`: Added a new method `_generate_error_log` to compile and format error logs based on analysis data.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of Detailed Error Logging**: Implemented a method to generate error logs that include summaries of security issues, code quality problems, and documentation deficiencies, along with specific recommendations and metrics.
- **Structured Output Format**: The error logs are formatted with markdown to enhance readability and include headers, bullet points, and code snippets where applicable.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies added.
- No configuration changes noted.
- No API changes or new endpoints introduced.
- No database schema changes detected.

## Next Steps
The next logical step would be to integrate this error logging functionality into the broader system's error handling and reporting mechanisms. This could include automated alerts based on severity levels identified in the logs or integration with project management tools to automatically create issues or tasks based on the logs. Further refinement of the error categorization and prioritization based on real-world usage feedback could also enhance the utility of the logs.
