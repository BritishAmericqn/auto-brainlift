## Summary
This commit introduces enhanced Slack integration capabilities into the main Electron application, focusing on automated progress updates. New functionalities include checking project selection, Slack configuration, gathering and sending project progress details to Slack, and error handling for git-related operations. These changes aim to automate the communication of project status updates, facilitating better project management and team communication.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js:** Added new Slack integration functionalities, included additional Node.js modules (`child_process` and `util`), and implemented asynchronous command execution using `promisify`.

## Key Changes
- **Enhanced Slack Integration:** Introduced a new IPC event handler `slack:send-progress-update` to gather and send project updates to Slack automatically.
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Implemented `promisify` for the `exec` method from `child_process` to support async/await patterns in executing shell commands, improving the handling of git commands.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Added robust error handling and logging for git operations, ensuring that issues are logged and do not interrupt the application's functionality.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added:**
  - `util`: Used for promisifying Node.js asynchronous functions.
- **Configuration Changes:**
  - No direct changes, but the usage pattern of `child_process` module has been extended to include `exec`.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints:**
  - Introduced new IPC handler `slack:send-progress-update` for internal communication within the Electron app.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on refining the Slack integration by adding more detailed project metrics, improving error handling, and expanding the types of notifications sent. Additionally, considering the results of the security and quality analyses, addressing the identified high-severity security issues and improving code documentation and quality should be prioritized to maintain the integrity and usability of the application.
