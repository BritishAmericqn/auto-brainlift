## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements to the caching mechanism and file management in the `GitCommitSummarizer` class within the `langgraph_agent.py` file. Specifically, it focuses on ensuring that even with cache hits, the system writes new files with current timestamps for visibility in user interfaces, and it replaces a basic hashing mechanism with a more robust SHA256 hash for cache keys based on changes in the working directory and staged files.

## Files Changed
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**: Updated to include new imports, modified caching logic with SHA256, and enhanced file output management for cached data.

## Key Changes
- Introduced SHA256 hashing for generating deterministic cache keys to improve the reliability of caching mechanisms.
- Modified the file output behavior on cache hits to update file timestamps, ensuring the latest interaction is visible and distinguishable.
- Enhanced the handling of the cached summaries by appending additional content if available, improving the depth and usefulness of cached outputs.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: Added the `hashlib` library for SHA256 hashing.
- **Configuration Changes**: No direct configuration changes noted, but caching behavior and file management logic have been significantly altered.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No API changes or new endpoints introduced in this commit.
- **Database Schema Changes**: No database schema changes were made.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on optimizing the caching strategy further, possibly by integrating more intelligent invalidation techniques or by expanding the metadata stored with each cache entry to enhance traceability and debugging capabilities. Additionally, considering the updates in handling cached data, it might be beneficial to review and possibly enhance the user interface that interacts with these files to make use of the new timestamping and content structuring.
