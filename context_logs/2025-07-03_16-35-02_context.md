## Summary
This commit introduces a comprehensive Slack Integration Guide and makes a minor update to a Python script. The Slack Integration Guide details both manual and automated features for updating team members about project progress via Slack, including setup instructions, usage details, and troubleshooting tips. Additionally, a Python file (`langgraph_agent.py`) was updated, specifically adding a new import (`hashlib`), suggesting enhancements related to security or data integrity.

## Files Changed
- **SLACK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: New file created to provide detailed instructions and best practices for integrating Slack with the Auto-Brainlift system.
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**: Updated to include the `hashlib` module, likely for enhancing functionality related to data handling and security.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of Slack Integration**: The guide outlines steps to integrate Slack for manual and automated notifications, enhancing team communication and workflow efficiency.
- **Automated Notifications via Git Hooks**: Setup instructions for Git hooks that trigger Slack notifications, promoting real-time updates and progress tracking.
- **Security Enhancement in Python Script**: By importing `hashlib`, the script potentially incorporates enhanced data validation or encryption features.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: The Python script now imports `hashlib`, a module frequently used for secure data handling.
- **Configuration Changes**: Detailed setup and configuration steps for Slack integration are provided, including bot permissions and OAuth tokens.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Although not explicit about API changes, the guide does involve interactions with Slack's API for bot integration and message posting.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would involve:
- **Monitoring and refining the Slack integration**: Observing how the integration impacts team productivity and making adjustments based on feedback.
- **Further development of automated tools**: Expanding the capabilities of the Python script to leverage the new `hashlib` dependency for additional security or performance features.
- **Enhanced error handling and security checks**: Given the medium severity security issues found, focusing on tightening security measures around new integrations and data handling processes would be crucial.
