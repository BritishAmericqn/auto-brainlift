## Summary
The latest commit introduces multiproject support for the Auto-Brainlift tool, transitioning it from a single-project to a multi-project capable development assistant. This enhancement includes significant UI updates for project management, a robust multi-tier caching system for cost optimization, and a new project-specific data storage architecture.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: Newly added file that outlines the expansion strategy, including phased implementation steps, goals, and technical specifications for the Auto-Brainlift tool.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a multi-project architecture that allows users to manage multiple projects within the Auto-Brainlift tool.
- Enhanced UI controls for project management including project switching, history viewing, and settings for API keys and budgets.
- Implementation of a multi-tier caching system aimed at reducing API costs and optimizing token usage.
- New project-specific configurations and storage paths to maintain separate histories and settings for each project.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None specified in the commit, but the implementation of caching and project management likely involves additional libraries for handling JSON data and UI enhancements.
- **Configuration Changes**: Addition of `projects.json` for storing project-specific configurations such as path, name, last commit, creation date, and settings like token budget and enabled agents.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the system likely requires new API endpoints for project management and cache interactions.
- **Database Schema Changes**: Introduction of a per-project storage system with directories for caches and outputs, including databases for exact and semantic caching.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would include:
- Implementing the backend functionality to support the new UI features and project management controls.
- Development and testing of the caching mechanisms described in the multi-tier caching system to ensure they meet the performance and cost-saving goals.
- Further integration testing to validate the seamless switching between projects and the accuracy of cost tracking in a multi-project environment.
