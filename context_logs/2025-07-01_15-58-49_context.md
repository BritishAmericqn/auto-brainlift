## Summary
The recent commit by Benjamin Royston introduced a new function `_generate_error_log` in `langgraph_agent.py` aimed at generating comprehensive error logs based on multi-agent analysis results. This update encapsulates the analysis of security issues, code quality, and documentation shortcomings, along with a summary of overall metrics and scores, thereby enhancing debugging and maintenance capabilities.

## Files Changed
- `agents/langgraph_agent.py`: Added a detailed error logging function `_generate_error_log` to compile analysis results into structured error logs.

## Key Changes
- Introduced a method to generate detailed error logs for multi-agent analysis results, which includes handling security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and documentation deficiencies.
- Included sections in the error log for security issues, code quality, documentation, and overall metrics like execution time and cost.
- Structured the error log with headers and formatted sections, improving readability and aiding in faster issue resolution.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added.
- No configuration changes noted.
- No new API endpoints or database schema changes were introduced.

## Next Steps
Given the structured approach to error logging and analysis, the next logical steps could involve:
- Enhancing the error log generation to automatically trigger alerts or integrate with monitoring tools based on severity levels or specific types of issues detected.
- Developing a feature to customize the level of detail in the generated logs based on user preferences or operational requirements.
- Improving the integration of this error logging with existing DevOps workflows, potentially offering real-time feedback during code commits or pull requests.
