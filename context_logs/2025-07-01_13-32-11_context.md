## Summary
The commit implements a multi-agent system in the Auto-Brainlift platform, enabling specialized code analysis through a flexible architecture that allows agents to be dynamically enabled or disabled based on user preferences and resource constraints. The system is designed to enhance security analysis, code quality assessment, and documentation evaluation, with configuration and execution managed through both environmental settings and a user interface.

## Files Changed
- **MULTI_AGENT_README.md:** Introduced the comprehensive documentation for the multi-agent system, covering architecture, configuration, usage, integration, cost management, caching, and error handling.
- **agent_orchestrator.py:** Added a new orchestrator script to manage the execution and coordination of multiple agents, ensuring efficient and error-resilient operations.

## Key Changes
- **Modular Agent Design:** Introduction of specialized agents (Security, Quality, Documentation) that operate independently but can be orchestrated together.
- **Flexible Execution Modes:** Agents can be executed in parallel, sequentially, or based on priority, configurable through environment variables.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Agents and execution modes can be configured via environment variables and a UI, allowing users to tailor the analysis to their needs.
- **Integration with LangGraph:** The system integrates with the existing LangGraph workflow, facilitating seamless operations within the broader ecosystem.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies:** Utilizes existing libraries such as `asyncio`, `json`, and `concurrent.futures`, with specific integration points in the `langgraph` and `langchain_core` libraries.
- **Configuration Changes:** Introduction of environment variables for agent settings, including enabling/disabling agents, selecting models, and specifying execution modes.
- **API Changes:** Not explicitly detailed in the provided diff, but the system likely interacts through defined interfaces in `base_agent.py`.
- **No Database Schema Changes:** No changes indicated in the provided diff.

## Next Steps
- **Testing and Validation:** Comprehensive testing to ensure each agent functions correctly individually and when orchestrated.
- **Performance Optimization:** Evaluate and enhance the performance, especially in parallel execution mode.
- **User Feedback Incorporation:** Collect user feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the multi-agent system to guide further enhancements.
- **Future Enhancements Implementation:** Based on the outlined future enhancements, work on allowing custom agents, defining dependencies (agent chaining), improving result aggregation, and enabling user-editable prompts.

This structured summary provides the AI with a clear understanding of the new multi-agent system's architecture, functionalities, and integration points, setting a foundation for future development and maintenance.
