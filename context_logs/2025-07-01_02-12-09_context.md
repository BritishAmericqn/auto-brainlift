## Summary
The latest commit introduces a strategic expansion for the Auto-Brainlift tool, transitioning it from a single-project utility to a multi-project supportive environment. This shift includes significant enhancements in UI, project management capabilities, and cost-efficiency features. The addition aims to facilitate seamless management across multiple projects and implement a tiered caching system to optimize API cost usage.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: New file created outlining the phased expansion plan for Auto-Brainlift, including detailed goals, implementation checklists, and testing protocols for multi-project support and smart caching systems.

## Key Changes
- **Enhanced UI for Multi-Project Management**: Introduction of new UI controls that allow users to manage multiple development projects, view project-specific information, and handle settings related to API keys and budgets.
- **Multi-Project Architecture Setup**: Implementation of a project registry and per-project storage, allowing the tool to handle data and settings separately for each project.
- **Introduction of Multi-Tier Caching System**: Setup of a sophisticated caching system with exact match cache, semantic cache, and a smart router to optimize query handling and reduce API costs.
- **Smart Cost Optimization Features**: Implementation of features like smart diff chunking and a token budget manager to monitor and control the usage of computational tokens based on predefined budgets.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: No new external dependencies were introduced in this commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: A new project registry (`~/.auto-brainlift/projects.json`) and directory structure under `~/.auto-brainlift/` for caching and outputs specific to each project.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No API changes or new endpoints were introduced in this commit.
- **Database Schema Changes**: The commit includes the setup for new local databases for caching (`semantic.db` and `exact.db`), though detailed schema changes are not specified.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on refining the caching algorithms and expanding the UI features to enhance user interaction and efficiency. Additionally, integrating feedback mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of the new multi-project management and caching strategies would be beneficial. Further security measures to protect project-specific data and settings could also be prioritized.
