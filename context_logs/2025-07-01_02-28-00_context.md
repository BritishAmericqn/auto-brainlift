## Summary
The commit `e1f1b77e` introduces a new test file, `test_token_tracking.md`, to verify the functionality of token tracking within the system. The file is part of a preliminary setup to ensure that token tracking mechanisms are being correctly monitored and analyzed within the codebase.

## Files Changed
- `test_token_tracking.md`: A new markdown file created to document the test process for token tracking.

## Key Changes
- A new markdown file was added to the project to serve as a placeholder or initial setup for testing token tracking functionality.
- The file contains a single line of text to denote its purpose, indicating a foundational step for more complex testing scenarios in the future.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added in this commit.
- There are no configuration changes or API changes.
- No database schema changes were introduced.

## Next Steps
Future steps will likely involve expanding the test documentation to include specific test cases, scenarios, and expected outcomes for token tracking. Additionally, implementation of actual test scripts to perform the described tests might be developed.
