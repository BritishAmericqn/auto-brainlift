## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements in the `GitCommitSummarizer` class within `langgraph_agent.py` to handle Work in Progress (WIP) commits more effectively. It adds functionality for generating deterministic hashes for WIP commits based on the content of changes, whether staged or unstaged. Additionally, it manages cache interactions to ensure that even on a cache hit, updated files are written to reflect current timestamps, improving the traceability and auditability of changes.

## Files Changed
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**: Enhanced to include deterministic hash generation for WIP commits, differentiation between staged and unstaged changes, and improved file handling on cache hits.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of `hashlib` for generating deterministic hashes, enhancing the reproducibility of WIP commit identifiers.
- Modification to the WIP commit logic to include both staged and unstaged changes distinctly, improving the accuracy of change tracking.
- Enhanced cache interaction to write new files with current timestamps on cache hits, ensuring data freshness and validity.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: `hashlib` for hash generation.
- **Configuration Changes**: None explicitly mentioned.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No new APIs or endpoints introduced.
- **Database Schema Changes**: None mentioned.

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could focus on optimizing the caching mechanism to further reduce computation on repeated accesses, potentially by refining the granularity of what changes are considered 'significant' enough to warrant cache invalidation or update. Additionally, expanding the unit tests to cover new logic paths introduced in this commit would ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
