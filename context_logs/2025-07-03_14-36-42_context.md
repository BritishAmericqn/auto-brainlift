## Summary
The commit introduces enhancements to the Git functionalities within an Electron-based application, specifically adding a new feature for staging files for commits. Additionally, the UI for Git operations has been redesigned to offer a more organized and user-friendly interface. The changes aim to streamline developer interactions with Git through the application's interface.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Added a handler for the 'git:add' IPC event to stage files in the Git repository.
- **electron/preload.js**: Extended the Git API exposed to the renderer process to include the 'add' function.
- **index.html**: Removed styling related to status messages and introduced a new layout and controls for Git operations within the UI.

## Key Changes
- Introduced a new IPC handler for 'git:add' to manage staging files in a Git repository directly from the Electron app.
- Updated the Electron preload script to allow renderer processes to call the 'git:add' functionality.
- UI redesign in the HTML removes old status message styles and adds new sections and controls for better management of Git functionalities.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies added.
- No configuration changes noted.
- API changes:
  - New IPC event 'git:add' for staging files.
- No database schema changes.

## Next Steps
Following the integration of the 'git:add' functionality and UI updates, the next logical steps could include:
- Implementing error handling and user feedback in the UI to reflect the success or failure of Git operations.
- Expanding the Git functionalities further, perhaps by integrating more complex Git operations like branching and merging.
- Enhancing security measures given the medium severity issues found, potentially by reviewing and improving how user inputs and file paths are handled to prevent code injection.
