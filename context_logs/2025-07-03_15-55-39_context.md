## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements to the Slack integration features within an Electron-based application. Major functionalities include the ability to send progress updates to Slack, which involves gathering data on project status, recent commits, context logs, and error logs. The implementation leverages async/await for executing shell commands and processing their results, thus improving the interaction with the Git repository and system files.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Expanded to include new Slack IPC handlers and utility functions for asynchronous execution of shell commands using `promisify`.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of `execAsync`**: Utilizing `promisify` from Node.js to convert `exec` to promise-based for better async handling.
- **New IPC handler `slack:send-progress-update`**: Implements comprehensive project status reporting including Git branch status, commit history, and file change logs, which are then formatted and sent to Slack if configured.
- **Enhanced Slack integration**: Checks and handles Slack configuration status before attempting to send updates.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**:
  - `util.promisify` is now used to handle asynchronous operations more efficiently.
- **Configuration Changes**:
  - No direct changes but utilization of existing configurations (like `slackEnabled` and `slackToken`) to manage new features.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**:
  - New IPC events for handling Slack communications have been introduced.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on refining the error handling and reporting mechanisms, particularly improving how git-related errors and file system access issues are managed. Enhancing the security and efficiency of data handling, especially when interfacing with external systems like Slack, will also be crucial. Additionally, considering the extension of these new functionalities to other parts of the application could provide more cohesive features for users.
