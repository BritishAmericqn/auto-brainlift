## Summary
This commit introduces a new test summary handler for Slack integration within the application, enhancing debugging and validation of Slack notifications related to project summaries. It also improves the existing codebase by refining the parsing logic for project summary scores and adding more detailed logging for easier troubleshooting.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Added a new Slack test summary handler, updated the parsing functions for project summary content, and enhanced logging for debugging purposes.

## Key Changes
- **New Slack Test Summary Handler**: Added functionality to test Slack integration by sending a test summary message, which verifies the configuration and operational status of Slack notifications.
- **Enhanced Parsing Logic**: Updated parsing expressions in `parseBrainliftContent` function to improve compatibility and reliability in extracting project scores from summary content.
- **Extended Logging**: Increased logging within parsing functions to include success and failure messages, which aids in debugging and maintaining the system.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added in this commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: No direct changes, but the code checks for Slack configuration such as tokens and channel settings, which must be correctly set up in the global settings for successful operation.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Introduced a new IPC handler `slack:test-summary` to facilitate testing of the Slack integration directly from the application's main process.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps include:
- Further testing and validation in different operational environments to ensure robustness across various configurations.
- Potentially expanding the test handler to include more integrative tests covering other aspects of Slack integration.
- Considering user feedback on the test functionality to enhance or adjust features accordingly.
- Monitoring the logs for any issues reported during the use of the new test summary handler and making necessary adjustments.
