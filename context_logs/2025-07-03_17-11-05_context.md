## Summary
This commit introduces several optimizations and adjustments to improve rendering performance and user experience on a web modal component. It focuses on enhancing GPU acceleration, reducing filter intensities, adding new CSS properties for continuous rendering, and ensuring better visibility during scrolling. These changes are aimed to enhance performance, especially on devices with lower capabilities, and provide a smoother interaction with the modal elements.

## Files Changed
- **index.html**: Modifications include changes to CSS properties for modal elements to optimize rendering and animation during user interactions.

## Key Changes
- Reduced the intensity of `backdrop-filter` from `blur(5px)` to `blur(3px)` to enhance performance.
- Added `will-change` and `transform: translateZ(0)` properties to promote GPU layer optimization.
- Introduced `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` and `overscroll-behavior: contain` for smoother scrolling on webkit browsers.
- Adjustments to `animation-play-state` and `content-visibility` properties to ensure continuous rendering and visibility during scroll.
- Elimination of `backdrop-filter` from certain form elements, replacing it with a solid background color to reduce rendering load.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies added.
- No configuration changes noted.
- No API changes or new endpoints reported.
- No database schema changes were made.

## Next Steps
Further testing on various devices to assess the impact of these changes on performance and user experience is recommended. Monitoring the performance metrics can help in understanding if further optimizations are necessary. Additionally, considering the low documentation score, enhancing inline comments and external documentation to better explain the new properties and changes for future maintainability should be prioritized.
