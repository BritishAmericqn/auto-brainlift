## Summary
This commit enhances the `langgraph_agent.py` by implementing functionality to handle Work-in-Progress (WIP) changes alongside the existing commit-based parsing. It introduces conditional logic to parse either the entire set of working directory changes or only staged changes, depending on the WIP mode specified. This improvement makes the agent versatile in environments where frequent updates occur without immediate commits.

## Files Changed
- `agents/langgraph_agent.py`: Expanded the `parse_git_diff` method to support parsing WIP changes based on user-defined modes, either capturing all changes or only staged changes.

## Key Changes
- Added support for WIP analysis in `parse_git_diff` method, which allows the agent to handle uncommitted, both staged and unstaged changes.
- Introduced conditional logic to switch between WIP mode and regular commit parsing depending on the presence of a `wip_mode` flag in the state dictionary.
- Enhanced logging to provide better insights during WIP parsing, facilitating easier debugging and monitoring.
- Structured the output to include WIP-specific commit information, such as a dynamically generated commit hash and descriptive metadata tailored for WIP scenarios.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added.
- No configuration changes or API changes were noted.
- The database schema remains unchanged as this modification pertains only to in-memory operations and logging.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would include:
- Implementing automated tests to ensure the new WIP parsing functionality works as expected across various scenarios.
- Enhancing the UI/UX to allow users to easily toggle between WIP modes and view the differences parsed by this new functionality.
- Considering the integration of this WIP parsing into other parts of the system where real-time data handling could be beneficial.
- Monitoring and optimizing performance as the new logic might introduce overhead when parsing large diffs or frequent changes. 

This structured approach ensures that the AI maintains an understanding of the ongoing development process, catering to both committed and uncommitted changes in the workflow.
