## Summary
The commit implements a comprehensive caching system for the Auto-Brainlift project, marking a significant enhancement in resource optimization. This includes the deployment of a multi-tier caching system intended to reduce API costs considerably while ensuring efficient query processing. The changes also encompass updates to the system's configurations and the introduction of a detailed guide for Phase 2 caching.

## Files Changed
- **Expanded_Checklist.txt**: Updated task statuses from pending to completed across several caching and system management functionalities.
- **PHASE2_CACHING_GUIDE.md**: Added as a new document to provide an extensive guide on the newly implemented smart caching system.

## Key Changes
- Implemented a 3-tier caching system with configurations for exact match, semantic similarity, and full LLM processing.
- Introduced a smart query router to optimize the processing flow depending on query complexity.
- Added a token budget manager for cost management on a per-commit basis.
- Addressed and fixed several system path and caching statistic inaccuracies.

## Technical Details
- Utilized `text-embedding-ada-002` for the semantic cache and configured various TTL settings for different cache levels.
- No new dependencies noted; however, the use of existing technologies like in-memory hashmaps, MD5 hashing, and vector databases was optimized.
- No explicit API changes mentioned, but internal API calls may have been adjusted to accommodate the new caching logic.
- No database schema changes reported, but the structure for cache storage was detailed in the guide.

## Next Steps
Future steps may include further optimization of cache hit rates, enhancements to the user interface for better monitoring and control of caching parameters, and potentially expanding caching strategies to other parts of the system. Additionally, continuous monitoring and tweaking of the caching thresholds and TTL values based on real-world usage data would be beneficial.
