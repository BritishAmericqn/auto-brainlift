## Summary
This commit introduces enhanced Slack integration and project monitoring capabilities to the Electron-based application. Key features added include asynchronous execution of shell commands for Git operations and gathering of project progress data for Slack updates. The changes are designed to provide timely project status reports, facilitating better project management and communication.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Expanded child process functionalities, integrated project progress reporting features, and enhanced Slack notifications.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of execAsync**: Utilizes Node.js's `promisify` to handle shell commands asynchronously, improving the application's efficiency in executing Git commands.
- **New Slack Integration Feature**: Added a new IPC event handler `slack:send-progress-update` to gather and send project progress updates to Slack, which helps in keeping the team informed about the project status.
- **Enhanced Project Management Monitoring**: Detailed tracking of project modifications, including branch status, commit history, and file changes, which are crucial for real-time project oversight.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: 
  - `const { promisify } = require('util');` for promisifying Node.js functions.
- **Configuration Changes**: 
  - Expanded the `child_process` module's usage by adding `exec` alongside `spawn`.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**:
  - Added new IPC handlers for Slack communications specifically for sending progress updates.

## Next Steps
The next logical steps would include refining the error handling for the new Git and Slack integration features, potentially adding user settings to enable or disable these notifications. Additionally, considering the security and quality scores, a thorough review and enhancement of the security measures and code refactoring are imperative to boost the application's robustness and maintainability.
