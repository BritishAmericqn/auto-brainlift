## Summary
The commit introduces foundational support for multiproject management within the Auto-Brainlift tool, transitioning it from a single-project assistant to one capable of handling multiple projects simultaneously. This change includes UI enhancements for better project management, a multi-tier caching system to optimize costs, and a smart routing system to efficiently handle queries based on budget constraints.

## Files Changed
- **EXPANSION_PLAN.md**: Newly added file outlining the phased expansion plan for Auto-Brainlift to support multiple projects, improve UI, introduce smart caching, and implement cost optimization strategies.

## Key Changes
- Introduction of a **Multi-Project Architecture** enabling Auto-Brainlift to manage multiple development projects simultaneously.
- **UI Enhancements** including new controls for project management such as switching projects, viewing history, and settings for API keys and budgets.
- Establishment of a **Multi-Tier Caching System** aimed at reducing API costs by implementing exact match caching, semantic caching, and a smart query router.
- **Smart Diff Chunking** and a **Token Budget Manager** to optimize token usage and adhere to budget constraints during project development.

## Technical Details
- New JSON configuration for project registry (`projects.json`) detailing each project's path, name, last commit, creation date, and settings.
- Introduction of project-specific storage directories for caching and outputs to maintain separation and organization of data across multiple projects.
- Implementation of new classes such as `ExactMatchCache`, `SemanticCache`, `SmartRouter`, and `DiffChunker` to handle specific functionalities within the caching and budget management systems.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on fully implementing and testing the multi-tier caching system to ensure it meets the cost reduction goals. Additionally, refining the UI based on user feedback to ensure that the new multi-project management features are intuitive and effective. Further integration of AI-driven features to enhance the smart routing system could also be explored to maximize resource efficiency.
