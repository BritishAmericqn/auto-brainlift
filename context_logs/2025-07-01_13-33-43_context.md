## Summary
The latest commit introduces a comprehensive error logging functionality in `langgraph_agent.py`. This function collects and formats detailed error logs based on multi-agent analysis results, encompassing security, code quality, and documentation aspects. The logs include metrics such as security scores, quality scores, documentation scores, and execution metrics, providing a structured overview of potential issues and recommendations for improvements.

## Files Changed
- `agents/langgraph_agent.py`: Added a new method `_generate_error_log` to compile detailed error logs from the results of multi-agent analyses.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of Error Logging**: Implemented a method to generate detailed error logs from the analysis performed by multiple agents, focusing on security issues, code quality, and documentation.
- **Security Issue Reporting**: The error log includes detailed descriptions of security vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations, enhancing the visibility of potential security risks.
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Logs detail the code quality issues, including type, impact, and suggestions for improvement, which helps in maintaining high code standards.
- **Documentation Evaluation**: The new logging method also evaluates documentation, listing missing pieces and quality issues, aiming to improve overall documentation coverage and quality.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added.
- There are no configuration changes or new API endpoints introduced.
- No database schema changes were made in this commit.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on automating the resolution of some of the simpler issues highlighted by the error logs, such as automatically fixing documentation gaps or refactoring code to address quality issues. Further integration with continuous integration tools could help in catching these issues in real-time, before they are merged into the main codebase.
