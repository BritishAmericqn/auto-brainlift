## Summary
The recent commit introduces enhancements to the caching and output file management in the `GitCommitSummarizer` class within the `langgraph_agent.py` file. Specifically, it improves how cache keys are generated for more deterministic behavior, and it modifies the logic for handling cached outputs to include timestamps, ensuring the visibility of new files in UI components.

## Files Changed
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**
  - Enhanced caching mechanism.
  - Modified output file generation to include timestamps and additional content.
  - Imported `hashlib` for deterministic hash calculations.

## Key Changes
- **Caching Mechanism Update**: Transitioned from using a simple hash function to the SHA256 algorithm for generating deterministic, collision-resistant hashes of the diff output.
- **Output File Management**: Introduced timestamped filenames for cached outputs to improve traceability and usability in user interfaces.
- **Content Augmentation for Output Files**: Cached output files now potentially include additional summaries (e.g., `cursor_chat_summary`), enriching the context and details provided.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: Imported `hashlib` for hashing functionalities.
- **Configuration Changes**: None reported.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No API changes or new endpoints introduced.
- **Database Schema Changes**: No database changes indicated.

## Next Steps
Future developments could focus on optimizing the caching strategy further to enhance performance and reduce redundant data storage. Additionally, exploring integration with front-end components to dynamically display these timestamped files could improve user experience. Further security analysis to address medium-severity issues found and improve the code quality score would also be beneficial.
