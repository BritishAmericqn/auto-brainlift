## Summary
The commit `e1f1b77e` introduces a new test file to verify the functionality of token tracking within the system. This is an initial setup to ensure that token tracking mechanisms are being correctly monitored and can be validated through automated tests in future developments.

## Files Changed
- `test_token_tracking.md`: A new markdown file created to document the testing of token tracking.

## Key Changes
- A new test file was added to the repository to serve as a basis for future tests related to token tracking.
- The file currently contains a single line of text indicating its purpose as a test commit for token tracking.

## Technical Details
- No new dependencies were added in this commit.
- There are no configuration changes or API changes introduced.
- No database schema changes were made.

## Next Steps
Future commits should expand upon this initial file to include actual test cases and potentially test scripts that can validate the functionality of token tracking. This might involve integrating with a testing framework and setting up specific scenarios to verify token handling under various conditions.
