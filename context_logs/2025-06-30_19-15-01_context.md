## Summary
The commit initialized a new project setup with foundational configurations and files for a React and TypeScript application using Vite, tailored for both web and Electron environments. The setup includes ESLint configurations, `.gitignore` settings to manage file versioning properly, a basic README for documentation, and the primary scaffolding for Electron integration with Vite.

## Files Changed
- **.eslintrc.cjs**: Introduced ESLint configuration tailored for a TypeScript and React project, including recommended settings and plugins.
- **.gitignore**: Configured to exclude logs, node modules, distribution folders, and various other files typically not tracked by version control in a Node.js environment.
- **README.md**: Created a basic project README outlining the project's technology stack and suggestions for expanding ESLint configurations.
- **dist-electron/main.js**: Set up the main Electron process file, configuring the application window and handling application lifecycle events.
- **dist-electron/preload.mjs**: Established a preload script for Electron, facilitating secure communication between the renderer and the main process using context isolation.

## Key Changes
- Established ESLint rules specifically targeting React and TypeScript, setting a standard for code quality and consistency.
- Configured `.gitignore` to support a typical Node.js development environment, especially handling logs and dependencies efficiently.
- Provided basic documentation through `README.md` to assist future developers in understanding and scaling the application.
- Implemented Electron's main process script and preload script, indicating a dual-target deployment for web and desktop.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: Electron, ESLint plugins for TypeScript and React, potentially others not explicitly listed in the diff.
- **Configuration Changes**: ESLint configuration is set up for TypeScript and React, including specific plugins and rules.
- **API changes or new endpoints**: None indicated in the provided diff.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on expanding the Electron integration, refining the ESLint configurations as the codebase grows, and adding more detailed documentation and developer guides in the `README.md`. Additionally, setting up frontend React components and integrating them with the Electron environment would be logical next steps.
