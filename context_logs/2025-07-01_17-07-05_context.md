## Summary
This Git commit involves the addition of demo instructions, a production deployment guide, and updates to the .gitignore and .env.example files to streamline setup processes and ignore additional files. The changes primarily support the preparation of the software, Auto-Brainlift, for demo and production environments.

## Files Changed
- **.env.example**: New file created to guide users in setting up their environment by adding an API key.
- **.gitignore**: Updated to include more file types and directories such as build artifacts and temporary files.
- **DEMO_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: New file providing detailed instructions for setting up and demonstrating the Auto-Brainlift application.
- **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: New file outlining comprehensive steps for deploying the Auto-Brainlift application in a production environment.

## Key Changes
- Added essential documentation to assist with application setup and deployment.
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by version control.
- Structured guidance for both demo and production setups to ensure smooth operation and deployment of the software.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added explicitly in the diff, but the deployment guide suggests dependencies related to Electron and Python for production builds.
- **Configuration Changes**: Introduction of .env.example for environment variable management.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No new API changes or endpoints introduced in this commit.

## Next Steps
Future steps could include addressing the known limitations mentioned in the demo instructions, such as implementing auto-update functionality and code signing. Additionally, enhancing the UI as discussed in recent development activities could also be prioritized to improve user experience.
