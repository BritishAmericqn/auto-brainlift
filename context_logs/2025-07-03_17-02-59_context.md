## Summary
This commit introduces a new agent, the CursorChatAgent, into the agent orchestration framework of the application. This enhancement aims to integrate context handling directly into the agent orchestrator, thereby centralizing and streamlining the management of different agents including security, quality, and documentation agents. The update includes modifications to the agent initialization and management, as well as to the summarization of results from various agents.

## Files Changed
- **agents/agent_orchestrator.py**: Added CursorChatAgent, updated ThreadPoolExecutor settings, and integrated the new agent's results into the overall scoring and summarization.
- **agents/langgraph_agent.py**: Removed direct initialization of CursorChatReader, reflecting the transition of its responsibilities to the CursorChatAgent, and updated environment configuration handling.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of CursorChatAgent**: A new agent was added to enhance context analysis capabilities within the agent orchestrator.
- **Modification of ThreadPoolExecutor**: Increased the number of workers from 3 to 4 to accommodate the new CursorChatAgent.
- **Centralization of Cursor Chat Handling**: Removed CursorChatReader initialization from `langgraph_agent.py`, indicating a shift towards handling cursor chat functionalities within the CursorChatAgent itself.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added explicitly in the diffs provided.
- **Configuration Changes**: Included environment variables for enabling and configuring the new CursorChatAgent.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: Not explicitly mentioned in the diffs provided.

## Next Steps
The logical next steps could involve further refining the integration of the CursorChatAgent to ensure it collaboratively works with existing agents. Additionally, monitoring and optimizing the performance impact due to the increased number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor may be necessary. Further testing and refinement might also be needed to balance the load and ensure the stability of the agent orchestrator.
