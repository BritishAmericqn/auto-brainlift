## Summary
The commit `ca8a3bac` primarily focuses on updating the `.gitignore` file to exclude specific test files containing potential fake tokens. This change is intended to enhance security by preventing accidental inclusion of sensitive data in the version-controlled repository.

## Files Changed
- **.gitignore**: Added new patterns to ignore files that may contain sensitive test tokens.

## Key Changes
- Exclusion patterns for test files (`test_*.js` and `verify_implementation.js`) were added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being tracked by Git. This measure addresses security concerns related to the accidental exposure of fake tokens.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added.
- **Configuration Changes**: Update to `.gitignore` to exclude specific files from version control.
- **API Changes**: None.
- **Database Schema Changes**: None.

## Next Steps
Considering the nature of the changes, the next steps could involve:
- Verifying that the new `.gitignore` rules effectively exclude all files that may potentially expose sensitive information.
- Conducting a full audit of existing version-controlled files to ensure no sensitive data was previously committed.
- Implementing similar security measures in other areas of the project as needed.
