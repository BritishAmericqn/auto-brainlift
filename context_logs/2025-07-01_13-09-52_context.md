## Summary
The latest commit implements a comprehensive multi-tier caching system in the Auto-Brainlift project, designed to optimize costs and improve response efficiency. This smart caching strategy marks significant progress in the systemâ€™s capability to handle queries more efficiently by using a combination of exact match and semantic similarity caches before resorting to full language model (LLM) processing.

## Files Changed
- **Expanded_Checklist.txt**: Updated the project checklist to reflect the completion of critical tasks related to the smart caching implementation.
- **PHASE2_CACHING_GUIDE.md**: Introduced a new file providing a detailed guide on the multi-tier caching system, including its architecture, key features, and technical specifications.

## Key Changes
- Implemented a **3-tier caching system** to reduce API costs and response times, involving exact match, semantic similarity, and full LLM processing.
- Added a **token budget manager** to monitor and control token usage per commit, with user-configurable limits and cost previews.
- Addressed and fixed issues related to path mismatches and incorrect cache statistics reporting in the system's environment.

## Technical Details
- **Dependencies**: Utilization of text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic caching and potentially new vector database storage solutions.
- **Configuration Changes**: Environment variables now include PROJECT_ID and BUDGET settings to customize caching and budget management.
- **API Changes**: Likely internal API adjustments to support new caching strategies and budget management features.
- **Database Schema**: Introduction of new structures to store cache data, including exact match and semantic caches, possibly in SQLite or similar vector-capable databases.

## Next Steps
Following the implementation of the smart caching system, the next logical steps might involve rigorous testing and optimization of the caching layers to ensure they meet performance expectations. Further, enhancements in the user interface for better visualization of cache performance metrics and cost management may be considered to enhance usability and transparency for developers.
