## Summary
This commit introduces enhancements to the Slack integration functionality within an Electron-based application. Specifically, it adds capabilities to send progress updates about the current project to Slack. This includes detailed git statistics, recent commits, and work context from log files, which helps in maintaining project transparency and team awareness.

## Files Changed
- **electron/main.js**: Added new IPC event handlers for Slack integration, included additional Node.js modules for asynchronous operations, and expanded the handling of project progress data.

## Key Changes
- **Promisification of `exec`**: Utilized `util.promisify` to convert the `exec` function from Node.js's `child_process` module for asynchronous use with async/await syntax, enhancing the code's readability and efficiency.
- **New Slack IPC Handler**: Implemented `ipcMain.handle('slack:send-progress-update', async () => {...})` to gather and send project updates to Slack, including error handling and data extraction from multiple sources.
- **Enhanced Git Integration**: Added functionality to retrieve detailed git statistics (like file changes, additions, deletions) and recent commits to provide comprehensive updates.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies Added**: `util` module is now explicitly required to use `promisify`.
- **Configuration Changes**: Existing configurations are leveraged with additional checks for Slack settings before sending updates.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No external API changes or new endpoints introduced, but internally, new IPC events are handled.

## Next Steps
Future development could focus on refining the error handling mechanism for the Git operations and expanding the scope of the project information sent to Slack. Additionally, integrating feedback mechanisms from Slack to the project could make the workflow more interactive and responsive. Continuous monitoring and updating of the documentation are essential to keep pace with these enhancements.
