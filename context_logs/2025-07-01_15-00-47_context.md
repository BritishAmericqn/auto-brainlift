## Summary
The latest commit introduces a mechanism for generating comprehensive error logs based on multi-agent analysis results within the `langgraph_agent.py` module. This feature captures and reports on security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and documentation gaps, providing a structured and detailed overview that enhances the debugging and maintenance process.

## Files Changed
- **langgraph_agent.py**: Added a new function `_generate_error_log` to compile and format error logs based on analysis from multiple agents regarding security, code quality, and documentation.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of detailed error logging**: Added the `_generate_error_log` function that consolidates findings from various analysis agents into a single, structured log.
- **Security, Quality, and Documentation Reporting**: Each category of issues (security, quality, documentation) is detailed in the logs with metrics like scores, severity, and specific recommendations.
- **Metrics and Execution Summary**: Included sections in the log for overall metrics such as the number of agents run, token usage, estimated costs, and execution time.

## Technical Details
- **New Dependencies**: None added in this commit.
- **Configuration Changes**: No changes in configuration noted in this commit.
- **API Changes or New Endpoints**: No API changes or new endpoints introduced.

## Next Steps
With the foundation for detailed error logging now integrated, future development could focus on refining the granularity of the logs, automating the action items based on recommendations, and potentially developing a UI to visualize these logs more effectively. Additionally, continuous improvement of the agents' analysis capabilities and coverage could further enhance the utility and accuracy of the generated logs.
