## 🎉 Phase 2: Style Guide Integration - COMPLETED

**Completion Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Development Time:** ~3 hours  
**AI Assistant:** Claude Opus 4  

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### **Core Feature: Style Guide Upload & Processing**
Teams can now upload their coding standards in multiple formats, and Auto-Brainlift automatically converts them to Cursor Rules for AI assistant guidance.

### **Supported Formats:**
- **JSON** - ESLint and Prettier configurations
- **YAML** - Team configuration files  
- **Markdown** - Documentation with coding guidelines
- **Text** - Plain text style guides

### **Advanced Features Implemented:**
1. **Multi-File Merging** - Files with same prefix + numbers are automatically merged (e.g., `teamstyle_1.txt` + `teamstyle_2.txt` = comprehensive guide)
2. **Smart Cleanup** - Old style guides with different prefixes are removed to prevent conflicts
3. **Permanent Protection** - Mark files as permanent to prevent deletion
4. **Large Preview** - 1500 character preview with 15-row textarea for better visibility

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Created/Modified:**
1. **`agents/style_guide_parser.py`** - Multi-format parser with intelligent rule extraction
2. **`electron/main.js`** - Added `style-guide:upload` IPC handler with validation
3. **`index.html`** - UI components for upload and preview
4. **`electron/preload.js`** - Extended API with styleGuide methods
5. **`requirements.txt`** - Added PyYAML dependency

### **Key Technical Details:**
- 1MB file size limit for security
- Project-specific isolation in `.auto-brainlift/style-guide/`
- Rule extraction: 50 rules per file, 150 for merged files
- `.permanent` file tracking for protected files
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### **1. Preview Truncation**
- **Problem:** Style guide preview cut off at "YAG..."
- **Solution:** Increased preview from 500 to 1500 chars, textarea from 8 to 15 rows

### **2. File Management Logic**
- **Problem:** Questions about old file handling
- **Solution:** Implemented smart cleanup with prefix matching and permanent protection

### **3. Upload Error Messages**
- **Problem:** "Upload failed" despite successful processing
- **Solution:** Fixed null reference in file sorting, added .DS_Store filtering

## ✅ Testing Completed

### **Test Files Created:**
```
test-style-guides/
├── eslint-config.json      # ESLint configuration
├── prettier-config.json    # Prettier settings
├── javascript-style-guide.md # Markdown guidelines
├── team-standards.yaml     # YAML team config
├── simple-rules.txt        # Plain text rules
├── teamstyle_1.txt         # Multi-file test (part 1)
├── teamstyle_2.txt         # Multi-file test (part 2)
└── teamstyle_3.txt         # Multi-file test (part 3)
```

### **All Test Scenarios Passed:**
- ✅ Single file uploads for each format
- ✅ Multi-file merging (120+ combined rules)
- ✅ Permanent file protection
- ✅ Cleanup of old files
- ✅ Error handling for invalid files
- ✅ Project isolation verified
