## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 65/100
**Severity Level:** MEDIUM

### Issue #1: Command Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The code snippet allows for file paths to be passed to a Python script execution in the file upload handler without proper sanitization/validation. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure all inputs (especially file paths) are sanitized and validated rigorously before being used in command executions. Use whitelisting for allowed characters and verify against it.

---

### Issue #2: Insecure File Upload Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The file upload handler does check for file extensions and size but does not explicitly check for the content type or other potentially malicious content within the files, which can lead to the uploading of executable scripts or other harmful files disguised with allowed extensions.

**Recommendation:**
Implement content validation checks, not just extension or size checks. Consider comprehensive scanning of files for potentially malicious content or anomalies before processing.

---

### Issue #3: Path Traversal
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The current implementation may not adequately prevent path traversal attacks where an attacker manipulates file paths to access unauthorized directories.

**Recommendation:**
Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal. Implement strict input validation to ensure no directory traversal tokens or patterns (e.g., '../') are allowed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 85/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
While error handling appears to be considered in file uploads, the specifics of error management and propagation are not specified in the provided code diffs.

**Suggestion:**
Implement detailed error logging and handling mechanisms, possibly by leveraging try-catch blocks and meaningful error messages to the user.

---

### Issue #2: Performance
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
There is no evident consideration of performance implications such as handling large volumes of files simultaneously or potential memory overhead.

**Suggestion:**
Ensure that the system can handle potential high load and volume by implementing queue systems, or asynchronous file handling routines.
