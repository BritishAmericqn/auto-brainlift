## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 75/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Code Duplication
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/langgraph_agent.py:502-550
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The error logging method `_generate_error_log` includes repetitive code structures for handling different types of analysis results, which can be refactored to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

**Suggestion:**
Refactor common patterns into helper functions or classes to handle shared behavior across different sections.

### Issue #2: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/langgraph_agent.py:502-550
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The method `_generate_error_log` relies on specific structure and keys of the `results` dictionary without handling missing keys gracefully besides the initial checks, which could lead to KeyErrors if the dictionary structure is altered.

**Suggestion:**
Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected or missing data in the results dictionary.
