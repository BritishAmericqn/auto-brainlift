### Issue #1: Phishing Risk
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The document includes a clickable URL (https://api.slack.com/apps) for creating a Slack app. If this document or its distribution method is not secured, it could potentially be modified to lead users to a malicious website, posing a phishing risk.
