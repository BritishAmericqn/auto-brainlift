## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 55/100
**Severity Level:** MEDIUM

### Issue #1: Code Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The use of unvalidated input file paths in `ipcMain.handle('style-guide:upload', async (event, filePath, options) => {})` could allow attackers to manipulate the file path to access or execute unauthorized files.

**Recommendation:**
Sanitize and validate all input paths to ensure they are confined to the intended directories and have no special characters that could lead to directory traversal or other exploits.

---

### Issue #2: Arbitrary Code Execution
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
By accepting file uploads and calling a Python parser script without adequately validating the contents and type of the files, the application risk executing malicious code if the uploaded files are crafted to execute upon parsing.

**Recommendation:**
Implement content-type verification and use a secure parsing method that treats the file contents as data, not executable code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 75/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js, agents/style_guide_parser.py
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Insufficient error handling detail in file upload and parsing logic.

**Suggestion:**
Add more robust error checking and specific error messages for different failure cases to improve debugging and user feedback.

---

### Issue #2: Test Coverage
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/style_guide_parser.py, electron/main.js
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Tests for new features in Python parser and Electron file handling script are not detailed in the commit.

**Suggestion:**
Ensure full test coverage for all new methods and error handling in both Python and JavaScript components. Include tests for edge cases and failure modes.

---

### Issue #3: Code Complexity
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The addition of handling options and added processing steps increases the complexity of the file upload handler.

**Suggestion:**
Refactor to simplify the logic, potentially breaking down the handler into smaller functions focusing on specific tasks (file validation, file copying, parsing, rule storage).
