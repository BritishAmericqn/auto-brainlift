## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 70/100
**Severity Level:** MEDIUM

### Issue #1: Remote Code Execution
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The ipcMain handlers for git operations such as status, commit, push, and pull are potentially vulnerable to injection attacks if not properly validating and sanitizing incoming data. Specifically, unsanitized input could be executed in the git operations, leading to execution of arbitrary commands.

**Recommendation:**
Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization. Ensure that parameters passed from the front-end to the git operations are strictly defined and escape characters that could allow command injection.

### Issue #2: Insecure Exception Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The implementation details of error handling in the git operation handlers are not provided. Inadequate error handling can leak sensitive data about the underlying system or result in unhandled exceptions that could destabilize the application.

**Recommendation:**
Implement comprehensive error handling and logging. Make sure to catch exceptions and format error messages that do not leak sensitive data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 85/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Documentation Completeness
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** CURSOR_AI_CHECKLIST.md:78
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The documentation for the AI Commit Message Generator is not fully updated. The step completion markers (- [x]) are there, but the detailed implementation and testing results are not specified.

**Suggestion:**
Complete the documentation to include specifics about how testing was conducted and the outcomes to assure all stakeholders of the robustness of the new feature.

### Issue #2: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** CURSOR_AI_CHECKLIST.md:50
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
While tick boxes indicate that error handling has been implemented, the commit lacks detailed information or specific code changes about how errors are managed, especially in edge cases.

**Suggestion:**
Ensure that the code implementations for git operations include detailed and robust error handling, capturing and logging detailed error information for troubleshooting and ensure graceful degradation of service.
