## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 70/100
**Severity Level:** LOW

### Issue #1: Local File Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The change log states that when the application is first run, users are instructed to right-click and open to bypass security warnings. This could inadvertently encourage users to ignore security protections, which may be exploited by other malicious software.

**Recommendation:**
Avoid instructing users to bypass security warnings. Instead, ensure the application is signed properly to avoid such warnings naturally.

### Issue #2: Data Privacy/Storage
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The addition of the .cursor/ directory to .gitignore suggests user-specific settings or data that are not meant to be pushed to repositories. However, there's no explicit mention of encryption or secure handling of these files, which could include sensitive information.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure any sensitive data stored locally by Cursor Rules is encrypted and securely handled to protect user data privacy.

### Issue #3: Dependency and Configuration Management
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Cursor Rules Integration potentially reads various logs and settings as mentioned which could be manipulated if there's an improper access control or input validation.

**Recommendation:**
Implement strict input validation and access control mechanisms for handling rule configurations and log files.
