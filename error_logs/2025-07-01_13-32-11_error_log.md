## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 60/100
**Severity Level:** MEDIUM

### Issue #1: Insecure Configuration
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The system reads sensitive configuration from environment variables which might be exposed to other processes or logged inadvertently. This includes execution modes and model selection which, if manipulated, could lead to unauthorized operations or performance degradation.

**Recommendation:**
Use a more secure method of configuration storage such as encrypted configuration files or a secure configuration management system. Minimize the use of environment variables for sensitive or critical configuration settings.

### Issue #2: Potential Remote Code Execution
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The agent orchestrator and agents might be exposed to code execution attacks if LLM models are not securely managed or if input to these models is not properly sanitized, especially since model identifiers like 'gpt-4-turbo' can be specified in configurations.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure that all data input into LLM models is sanitized and validate configuration settings against a strict schema to prevent injection attacks. Implement strong access control and use signed models only.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 75/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/MULTI_AGENT_README.md:-
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The current documentation does not mention error handling strategies within the agents or during multi-agent execution, which is critical for robust software performance.

**Suggestion:**
Incorporate comprehensive error handling and exception management strategies in the documentation and implementation.

---

### Issue #2: Test Coverage
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/MULTI_AGENT_README.md:136
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The only reference to testing is running a test script for integration, which may not cover unit testing, functional testing, or edge case validations for each agent or the orchestrator.

**Suggestion:**
Expand the test suite to include unit tests for each agent, functional tests for the agent orchestrator, and integration tests covering the full spectrum of potential operational scenarios.

---

### Issue #3: Documentation
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** agents/MULTI_AGENT_README.md:-
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Although there is good high-level documentation, detailed APIs or configuration specifics for each agent (like method signatures, data format expectations) are missing.

**Suggestion:**
Enhance the documentation with detailed API interfaces, expected data formats, configuration details, and example use cases for better clarity and usability.
