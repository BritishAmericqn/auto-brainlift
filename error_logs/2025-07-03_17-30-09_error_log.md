## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 85/100
**Severity Level:** LOW

### Issue #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The introduction of inline SVG icons could potentially expose the application to XSS if not properly sanitized, especially if dynamic content can influence SVG properties or content.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure that any dynamic content inserted into the SVG is properly escaped or sanitized. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 70/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Code Duplication
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:1762-1840
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Icon size and margin styles are repeated with slight variations for different classes which might make future changes more tedious.

**Suggestion:**
Consider using SASS or CSS variables for common properties to reduce duplication and enhance flexibility.

### Issue #2: Documentation
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:1762-1840
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The addition of complex CSS animations and icon adjustments lacks inline comments explaining purpose or context, especially for the animations.

**Suggestion:**
Add concise comments describing the reasoning or intended effect of specific style rules or groups, particularly for 'icon-spinning'.

### Issue #3: Performance
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:1767
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Use of CSS properties like 'will-change' can result in performance overhead if not handled cautiously.

**Suggestion:**
Verify the necessity of 'will-change' or limit its scope via script controlling when it's applied based on user interaction.

---

### Issue #4: Best Practices
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html: cuts off before completion
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Inline SVG code repetition in HTML buttons increases codebase size and decreases flexibility.

**Suggestion:**
Consider using an SVG sprite sheet or external SVGs to avoid duplication and ease icon management.
