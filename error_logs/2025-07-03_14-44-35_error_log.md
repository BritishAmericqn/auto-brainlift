## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 70/100
**Severity Level:** LOW

### Issue #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The application uses a textarea element for input without explicit sanitation shown in the provided code snippet. If unsanitized data is dynamically inserted into the HTML from user input or external sources without proper encoding, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are executed in the browser of another user.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure all user-generated content displayed in the browser is properly encoded or sanitized on the server-side or client-side before rendering. Libraries that automatically encode output could be used, or Content Security Policy (CSP) headers can be implemented to reduce the impact of XSS.

### Issue #1: Code Style
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:various
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

Inconsistencies in code formatting, such as spacing around properties and missing comments for new changes.

Adopt a consistent code style guideline and format the document accordingly. Use comments to explain the reason behind significant changes or new additions.

### Issue #2: Potential Bug
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:1660
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The display property for #commitMessageContainer is cut off, potentially a copy-pasting error. This leaves it undefined in terms of visibility which can lead to unexpected UI issues.

Ensure the complete line for the display property is properly added to specify the visibility state correctly.

**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:794
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The use of -webkit-backdrop-filter along with backdrop-filter can be resource-intensive on WebKit browsers, particularly on large areas.

**Suggestion:**
Conditionally apply filter effects based on the client's device capabilities to ensure smooth performance.
