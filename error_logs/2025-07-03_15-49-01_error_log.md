## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 30/100
**Severity Level:** HIGH

### Issue #1: Command Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The use of 'execAsync' function with dynamic input derived from the project path can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the project path is manipulated. Specifically, commands like 'git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD' and 'git status --porcelain' are executed with the dynamically obtained project path without sanitization.

**Recommendation:**
Sanitize and validate the project path before using it in the execAsync call. Consider using known secure patterns for handling shell commands and avoid direct insertion of variables into command strings.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 65/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Code Complexity
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1374-1477
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The 'slack:send-progress-update' handler is overly complex and lengthy, responsible for multiple actions such as retrieving project settings, fetching Git branch, detecting uncommitted changes, and parsing Git stat data.

**Suggestion:**
Refactor into smaller, more focused functions to handle specific tasks, improving modularity and testability.

---

### Issue #2: Maintainability
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:2-3
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Adding dependencies directly in main process can lead to bloating. Handling Git operations asynchronously might affect the main thread's performance, considering use in the renderer process or dedicated modules.

**Suggestion:**
Consider offloading the operations to web workers or another backend service to improve performance and responsiveness.

---

### Issue #3: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1374-156/
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Error handling is basic and does not differentiate between types of errors, which might confuse debugging and user feedback.

**Suggestion:**
Implement more granular error handling and logging mechanisms to provide clearer insights into failures.

---

### Issue #4: Documentation
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1374-1477
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The function 'slack:send-progress-update' lacks detailed inline documentation explaining its workings and the logic behind each step.

**Suggestion:**
Add concise comments within blocks of code, explaining the purpose and the logic of each significant step.
