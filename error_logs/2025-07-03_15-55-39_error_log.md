## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 60/100
**Severity Level:** MEDIUM

### Issue #1: Command Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The application uses async executions of shell commands without sanitizing or escaping user input or environment variables. This can allow attackers to inject additional commands.

**Recommendation:**
Sanitize and validate all inputs that are used in shell commands. Consider using more restrictive APIs that execute specific commands with fixed parameters.

---

### Issue #2: Insecure Configuration
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
There are no explicit security configurations or CSP (Content Security Policy) for Electron. Using default Electron security settings could expose the application to risks like XSS or remote code execution.

**Recommendation:**
Implement security settings for Electron including `nodeIntegration`, `enableRemoteModule`, `contextIsolation`, and a strict CSP. These help mitigate risks from exposure to XSS and remote code execution vulnerabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 65/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Code Duplication
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1378-1407
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Several instances of running git commands and processing results which could be abstracted into utility functions to avoid code duplication.

**Suggestion:**
Create generalized git utility functions for operations like getting the current branch, checking the git status, and retrieving diff statistics. This will reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

---

### Issue #2: High Cyclomatic Complexity
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1370
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The new handler 'slack:send-progress-update' is quite lengthy and handles multiple operations which increases its cyclomatic complexity.

**Suggestion:**
Break down the handler into several smaller, more focused functions. This will help in isolating functionality, simplifying unit testing, and improving readability.

---

### Issue #3: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1382
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Incomplete error handling in new git command executions. Errors from asynchronous operations are caught, but not all potential git errors are handled appropriately.

**Suggestion:**
Ensure that error handling is robust, including handling specific git errors that might not throw exceptions but result in non-standard outputs.
