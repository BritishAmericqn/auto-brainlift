## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 80/100
**Severity Level:** LOW

### Issue #1: CSS Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The 'transition' and 'transform' properties in CSS are being manipulated using class changes on user interaction (hover, click). If not properly validated, this can potentially be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS, especially if part of the values comes from user input or an insecure source.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure that any dynamic values inserted into the CSS are properly validated and sanitized to prevent CSS injection. Static use as demonstrated is generally safe unless combined with insecure dynamically sourced content.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 65/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Commit and code organization
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** commit message
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The commit message 'Work in Progress - All working directory changes' suggests a lack of specific focus which might include multiple unrelated changes in a single commit. This practice can make it difficult to track and manage individual changes.

**Suggestion:**
Divide changes into smaller, logically grouped commits with clear messages.

---

### Issue #2: CSS styles specificity and proliferation
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:CSS section
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Introduction of highly specific CSS rules for '.button-icon' and '.button-icon .icon' could lead to challenges in overriding these styles in different contexts, increasing the maintenance effort.

**Suggestion:**
Consider using more reusable and less specific CSS class names and modularizing CSS.

---

### Issue #3: Inline animation definitions
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:CSS section
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Animation behaviors are defined inline within CSS classes which may limit reuse and increase the difficulty in making systematic adjustments to animations.

**Suggestion:**
Refactor animation definitions into separate, reusable CSS classes or variables.

---

### Issue #4: Lack of error handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html:JavaScript section
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
There is no visible error handling for dynamic UI updates, such as failing to refresh status. This could lead to a poor user experience if the update fails.

**Suggestion:**
Implement error handling mechanisms to manage failures in UI update processes.

---

### Issue #5: Inconsistent CSS property values
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html in changed SVG paths
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The stroke-width property in SVG paths within button icons has been changed inconsistently, which could affect visual consistency across the application.

**Suggestion:**
Review and standardize the stroke-width and other style properties to ensure visual consistency.

---

### Issue #6: Documentation and comments
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** index.html
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Lack of comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of newly introduced UI elements and styles, particularly around new animations and icon changes.

**Suggestion:**
Add comments to complex styles and JavaScript code sections to improve understandability and maintainability.
