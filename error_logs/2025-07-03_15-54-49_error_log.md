## ðŸ”’ Security Issues

**Overall Security Score:** 40/100
**Severity Level:** HIGH

### Issue #1: Command Injection
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The use of `execAsync` to execute git commands based on user-controlled input without sufficient sanitization can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Recommendation:**
Sanitize and validate all user inputs thoroughly before using them in shell commands. Consider using more secure alternatives such as direct library calls if available.

---

### Issue #2: Insecure Logging
**File:** `Unknown`
**Line:** Unknown
**Severity:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The application logs potentially sensitive information about the project states and configuration. If not properly secured, this log could be accessed by unauthorized users, leading to information leakage.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure that logs containing sensitive information are protected with appropriate access controls, encrypted if possible, and regularly purged.

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Issues

**Overall Quality Score:** 65/100
**Code Complexity:** N/A

### Issue #1: Code Duplication
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1385-1420
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The logic for Git commands such as `git status --porcelain` and `git diff --shortstat` could exist in multiple places, potentially reflecting a lack of a centralized abstraction for Git operations.

**Suggestion:**
Consider creating a dedicated service or class to handle all Git-related operations, promoting reusability and single responsibility.

---

### Issue #2: Error Handling
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1370-1500
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Error handling is basic, focused on generic try/catch blocks. Specific errors related to exec operations or invalid outputs are not handled distinctly.

**Suggestion:**
Implement more specific error handling, for instance, differentiating between command execution errors and parsing errors. This can aid in troubleshooting and maintaining the software.

---

### Issue #3: Missing functionality
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1461
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
The addition of 'git diff --name-status' does not handle the output. This leaves an unfinished feature and makes the current implementation error-prone.

**Suggestion:**
Complete the implementation and ensure that outputs from commands are properly used or notified.

---

### Issue #4: Performance
**File:** `Unknown`
**Location:** electron/main.js:1380-1480
**Impact:** UNKNOWN

**Description:**
Multiple async operations (Git commands) seem to be executed sequentially rather than in parallel, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

**Suggestion:**
Review if some of the async operations can be parallelized using Promise.all to enhance the performance.
