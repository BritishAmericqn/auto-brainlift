# Auto-Brainlift v1.0.4 Release Notes

## Release Date: July 3, 2024

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Critical Build Issues
- **Fixed missing integrations directory** - The `integrations/**/*` directory is now properly included in production builds
- **Fixed Slack integration dependency** - Added `@slack/web-api` package to dependencies
- **Resolved module loading errors** - Production builds no longer throw "Cannot find module" errors

### üîß Technical Details

#### Build Configuration
- Updated `package.json` to include integrations directory in build files list
- Added `@slack/web-api` v6.11.2 to dependencies for Slack integration support

#### What Was Fixed
1. **Module Loading Error**: `Cannot find module './integrations/slack'`
   - Root cause: integrations directory was not included in electron-builder files list
   - Solution: Added `integrations/**/*` to build configuration

2. **Slack Dependency Error**: `Cannot find module '@slack/web-api'`
   - Root cause: Slack Web API package was not declared as a dependency
   - Solution: Added `@slack/web-api` to package.json dependencies
