**What I Set Out to Do**
My primary goal was to evolve Auto-Brainlift from a single-project tool to a robust multi-project support system. This transformation was crucial for scaling up and accommodating the diverse needs of our user base, managing multiple development environments seamlessly.

**The Journey**
The development kicked off by drafting an expansion plan, which was meticulously detailed in the newly created `EXPANSION_PLAN.md`. I outlined two major phases: enhancing the UI for better project management and implementing a sophisticated multi-tier caching system for cost optimization. The first phase involved integrating intuitive UI controls that allow users to manage multiple projects effortlessly. For the second phase, the focus was on reducing API costs and improving efficiency through smart caching and diff chunking.

**Challenges & Solutions**
One of the primary challenges was ensuring that the switch between different projects was seamless and state-preserving. The solution came in the form of a `Project Registry` which keeps track of each project's details and last activities. Implementing this feature required careful consideration of data structures and storage formats to ensure quick reads and writes.

Another significant challenge was designing the multi-tier caching system. Balancing the speed of exact match caches with the thoroughness of semantic caches required fine-tuning parameters like TTL values and similarity thresholds. I decided to prioritize speed for exact matches and accuracy for semantic searches, which led to a layered approach in caching strategy.

**Technical Insights**
A real "aha!" moment for me was during the implementation of the smart diff chunking. I discovered that by breaking down diffs recursively and maintaining semantic boundaries, we could drastically cut down on token usage without losing context. This not only optimized our operations but also provided a blueprint for handling similar problems in the future.

**Reflections**
Reflecting on the code, I feel a mix of pride and anticipation. The modular approach we've taken with the caching system and the dynamic UI updates for project management are aspects I'm particularly proud of. However, I recognize that the real test will come during the deployment and user feedback stages. If I were to do anything differently, I'd involve more frequent user testing sessions during the early stages of development to align more closely with user expectations and needs.

**Looking Forward**
Looking ahead, I'm excited about entering Phase 2, where we'll be focusing on smart caching and cost optimization. The potential of reducing API costs by 10x through intelligent routing and caching strategies is thrilling. Additionally, the upcoming user feedback on the multi-project support will be invaluable in refining our tool to better serve our users. This iterative improvement based on real-world usage is what will truly elevate Auto-Brainlift to the next level.
