**What I Set Out to Do**
Today, I embarked on a significant enhancement of our Auto-Brainlift tool, aiming to transform it from supporting single projects to handling multiple projects efficiently. This shift is crucial as it aligns with our vision of making Auto-Brainlift a more versatile and scalable development assistant.

**The Journey**
The journey started with drafting an expansive plan, which I laid out in the EXPANSION_PLAN.md file. Initially, I focused on building a robust multi-project architecture and an enhanced user interface. Creating intuitive UI controls for seamless project management and implementing a foundational multi-project setup were my starting points. I sketched out the necessary UI enhancements and began coding the backend JSON structures to support multiple projects.

**Challenges & Solutions**
One major challenge was ensuring that the transition between projects was seamless and state-aware, preserving individual project histories and settings without conflicts. To tackle this, I designed a project registry system that keeps each project's path, settings, and last commit. I also encountered hurdles with the UI responsiveness when switching between projects. This was primarily due to the increased load on the system. To solve this, I optimized the underlying project switching logic and started implementing a caching system that would later reduce API costs and improve performance.

**Technical Insights**
A significant "aha!" moment came when I devised the multi-tier caching system. Realizing that not all queries need to hit the most expensive resources, I segregated the cache into exact matches and semantic similarities, which not only reduced cost but also sped up response times. Implementing this was both challenging and rewarding, giving me deeper insights into efficient resource management and optimization in software.

**Reflections**
Reflecting on today's coding session, I feel proud of the groundwork laid for a more scalable and efficient Auto-Brainlift. However, I acknowledge that the UI needs more refinement to handle the increased complexity without compromising user experience. I think a bit more focus on front-end performance will be necessary in upcoming sessions.

**Looking Forward**
Going forward, I'm particularly excited about completing the smart caching and cost optimization phase. The potential to reduce API costs significantly and enhance the system's efficiency is thrilling. Additionally, getting user feedback on the multi-project capabilities will be crucial, as it will guide further refinements and feature additions. The road ahead is challenging but promising, and I'm eager to see Auto-Brainlift evolve into a tool that can genuinely uplift the development process across multiple projects.
