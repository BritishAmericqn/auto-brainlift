**What I Set Out to Do**
Initially, my main goal was to evolve Auto-Brainlift from a tool tailored for single-project assistance into a robust, multi-project development assistant. This transformation was aimed at enhancing user experience with a more intuitive UI and implementing a sophisticated system for managing costs across various projects.

**The Journey**
The process began with drafting the expansion plan, which laid out a clear path divided into phases. The first phase focused on introducing basic multi-project support and UI enhancements. I designed new UI elements like project management controls and indicators for project status and cost. For the backend, I structured a new multi-project architecture, including a project registry and per-project storage. This setup was pivotal in laying the groundwork for more advanced features planned for the second phase.

**Challenges & Solutions**
One significant challenge was ensuring the UI remained responsive and intuitive as we scaled to handle multiple projects. Initially, the switch project feature was sluggish, which could frustrate users managing several projects. To address this, I optimized the front-end code and revised how project data was loaded into the UI. Another major hurdle was accurate cost tracking. Implementing a token budget system required careful consideration to ensure it was both accurate and flexible. I decided to use a combination of in-memory and persistent storage to balance performance with reliability.

**Technical Insights**
Throughout this development, I learned a great deal about designing a scalable architecture that can gracefully handle growth. Implementing the multi-tier caching system was particularly enlightening. It was fascinating to see how different caching strategies could drastically reduce API costs and improve performance. The "aha!" moment came when integrating the exact match and semantic caches, which demonstrated immediate improvements in query handling efficiency.

**Reflections**
Reflecting on this code, I'm proud of the robustness of the architecture and the seamless user experience it provides. However, I think more work could be done to refine the caching logic and perhaps introduce more granular control for users over cache settings. I also see potential for deeper integration with AI models to predict and manage costs more dynamically.

**Looking Forward**
The next steps involve pushing forward with Phase 2, which includes implementing smart caching and cost optimization strategies. I'm particularly excited about developing the smart router and seeing how much we can reduce operational costs through intelligent query routing. Additionally, exploring more AI-driven features to enhance project insights and automations is something I look forward to with great anticipation.
